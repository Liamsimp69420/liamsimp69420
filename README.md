<h1> My poem </h1> 
<p> in all its glory </p> 

<p>i enjoy dick,<br>   

large and thicccccccc, <br>

slipery and slick, <br>

oh i enjoy dick, <br>

large and in my face, <br>  

i hope my search history can erase,<br>

like the milkyway, <br>

cream in outer space,<br>

oh i enjoy dick, <br>

rough and raw,<br> 

i like to gnaw,<br> 

on this dick, <br>

that is so thic, <br>

like a branch,<br>

not a stick,</p>
