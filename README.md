<h1> Owenism </h1>
<p>Owenism is a term coined by OWen and it means "to be an owen". Both "OWenism" and "to be an owen" are insults since owen said that they are insults. so when you see an Owen feel free to use terms like "b- student" and "only somewhat annoying" since these are complements to most owens.* <br><br>
*owen is my friend and i am only joking, saying things like "b- student" is pretty mean and insulting so pls be kind. no matter wat someone is named. even if it's "owen".</p>

<p> Wren is a beta male trying to fit in, he is a 4'7" hot blonde who might not acctually have hair. this cannot be confirmed but I think he's kinda cool. But anyways he and Asher have known each other since Asher's mom and Wren's mom have known each other 
<h1> Bodhi's life </h1>
<p> Asher and Eli were dating, but Bodhi wanted Eli. So when Asher wasn't looking Bodhi asked Eli out. But little did Bodhi know, Asher was looking. Asher confronted bodhi about it and they squared up. Torn by love for both Bodhi and Asher, Eli had to look on as Bodhi procceded to kick Asher's ass. Then all of a sudden a plane came from Ireland, it was Asher's dad. Asher thought that he would never see his dad again after what happend when he was 3. As Asher's father stepped out of the plane, his red hair shone bright in the evening sun. Bodhi immediatly fell for him like Asher's mom had years ago. As Bodhi was looking deep into Asher's dad's beautifull green eyes, Asher took Eli in his arms and ran off into the sun with him. The hole in Bodhi's heart made by the rejection of Eli was suddenly filled as he grabbed Asher's Dad's hand and, looking down on him asked, "will you marry me?"<br><br> The response from Asher's lost father shook Bodhi's heart more than any words could, "No, I came for Asher," his father said "I won't be complete until I have him." <br><br> Bodhi's limbs went weak, he dropped Asher's father in disbelief at his response. <br><br> At this moment Bodhi realized that there was only one man for him. He had to find Eli. He had experimented with Asher's father and it had only reminded him of his one true love. Bodhi ran towards the sun in search of Eli, his one and only shot at true love. He knew where Eli was headed, Madison Wisconsin, two years ago when Bodhi and Asher were dating Asher said that it was his favorite place on earth. Eli and Asher would be there, in search of true love.     </p>
